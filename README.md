# reactND-mobile-flashcard
This repository is for my Udacity React Nanodegree final project - mobile flashcard.  
Using React-native (Expo), I built a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. 
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Tested Platforms
The app was tested on Android 10

# How to start?
1. Clone or download this repository
